        "The dissolution and succession of federal states in the 20th century was heavily influenced by international legislation. If we view it from a methodological perspective, we can see that the dissolution of the Turkish Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was regulated by the peace treaties ending the First World War. The matter was different with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, because the Vienna agreements of international law provided legal measures. The Vienna Convention of 1978 concerns the succession and settlements of pastagreements. The Vienna Convention of 1983 deals with the succession of property and debt. In case of the breakup of a union (integration) it must remain a primary rule that the parties involved must reach an agreement on the distribution of property (archives) and debt. The pertaining Vienna agreement of 1983 has not yet come into force, and it is unlikely that it will in the foreseeable future. Despite the fact that the agreement is left to the parties, it would be desirable to regulate the process with legal means as well. In it, however, economic indicators must have an important role to play which we can see in the presented 20th century examples. On the other hand, political decisions are also present in the distribution of property and debt, in many cases at the expense of economic means. The regulation of the matter would be a common task, because it would prevent the uncertain outcomes of a series of forced decisions and agreements generating disputes just as we can witness their unregulation even today."

In September 1190, both kings appeared in the Sicilian city of Messina where they wereforced to spend winter. Sicily was under the rule of Tancred of Lecce, who seized the throne afterthe death of King William II of Sicily whose wife was Joanna, sister of King Richard. Tancred heldher in his custody and deprived her of her dowry and other possession. This was one of the reasonswhy Richard I soon fell into conflict with Tancred. He was also at odds with the hostile citizens ofMessina who attacked his forces and caused him many troubles. Open war with Tancred’s peoplewas interrupted only after the conclusion of the peace treaty on 6 October 1190. Tancred gave Richard20,000 ounces of gold as compensation of his sister’s dowry and the marriage was agreed uponbetween one of Tancred’s daughter and Richard’s nephew Arthur, duke of Brittany, whom Richardnamed his heir. Growing tension between Richard and Philip came to a head when Philip accusedRichard of violation of the treaty with Tancred. When Philip’s gossip was disproven by Richard himself,Philip was also forced to make a treaty with Richard. The main aim of this treaty was to releaseRichard from his oath to marry Philip’s sister, Alice since he was awaiting a new bride Berengaria ofNavarre. This treaty was concluded in March 1191. While the first treaty had an impact on events inEngland, the second freed Richard’s hands regarding his marriage diplomacy."

Others are young states which have become independent statehoods in the 19th and 20th centuries, either by breaking away from earlier states or by transforming their dependent and partial statehood in opposition to power politics. Such areas in Europe are the Balkan and Eastern-Europe, among whose young states Romania stands out because of the special historical development of its statehood and its territorial changes. The Romanian state became an independent European state over several historical periods, by building from several territorial bases, and through various kinds of political dependence, at the end of the 19th century. Later on, it grew its territory several times as a result of its peculiar 20th century politics. Until the end of the 19th century, it had consisted of two similarly structured but separate principalities: Wallachia and Moldova. The historical periods of the Romanian statehood basically correspond to the political processes dictated by the power states of the Balkan, Eastern- and Central-Europe, as its territory had shaped in their buffer zone."

        "The French Revolution had in that time fundamental importance and affected by different intensity also ideological developments in other European countries including the United Kingdom. Helen Maria Williams was known in England as a popular English poet and romantic writer. As well as many foreign admirers of Revolution also Williams left her native country under the influence of French Revolution events. In Paris she immediately succumbed to the Federation Festival charm. Williams’s almost uncritical revolutionary idealism remained until the time when The Mountain (La Montagne) was established and its terror started to dominate the Revolution. From 1790 to 1796 Williams published eight volumes of Letters from France and in this way she informed the British public about revolutionary events. Williams’s Letters are also an important source of information needed for understanding her relationship to the revolutionary events. In my article I will focus not only on some of her views on the Revolution but I will also deal with the reaction of British press to her Letters. The important part of this article will be the question of women’s rights because Williams devoted a large part of her work just the fate of women during the Revolution."

Helen Maria Williams was known in England as a popular English poet and romantic writer. As well as many foreign admirers of Revolution also Williams left her native country under the influence of French Revolution events. In Paris she immediately succumbed to the Federation Festival charm. Williams’s almost uncritical revolutionary idealism remained until the time when The Mountain (La Montagne) was established and its terror started to dominate the Revolution. From 1790 to 1796 Williams published eight volumes of Letters from France and in this way she informed the British public about revolutionary events. Williams’s Letters are also an important source of information needed for understanding her relationship to the revolutionary events. In my article I will focus not only on some of her views on the Revolution but I will also deal with the reaction of British press to her Letters. The important part of this article will be the question of women’s rights because Williams devoted a large part of her work just the fate of women during the Revolution.",

The formation of the first dominions by linking the until-then Self-governing Colonies together raised the question of what the position of the new Dominions to their mother country and the other parts of the Empire was. Before the outbreak of the First World War, matters related to the Dominion status were discussed at several Colonial, from 1907 Imperial Conferences; however, neither British nor Dominion politicians managed to reach an agreement or a complex solution. In fact, only partial solutions were adopted. At the turn of the 19th and 20th century, the British Government began to pursue defence matters intensively. A lot of foreign-policy issues, and in particular fear of German naval armaments, had a profound influence on the debate; indeed, this was the case to the extent that the significance of the second influential imperial institution, i.e. the Imperial Defence Committee, rose. Even though the system of imperial conferences, that served as a forum where crucial questions dealing with imperial, foreign, defence and economic policies were decided, was institutionalised and firmly “anchored” in the imperial structure, it had to compete with the powerful Imperial Defence Committee."

These sources seem similar to each other, e.g. due to the poetic form, Middle HighGerman language and a similar social position of the chroniclers, who were probably the secularpeople. The Chronicle of Otokar of Styria is not a simple World Chronicle. Otokar’s text contains hisdescription of the divided Central European region between 1246 and 1309. World Chronicles usuallycovered the tales of Holy Scripture, history of Ancient Greece, Persia and Rome up to the presentdays of chroniclers. These are not to be found read in Otokar’s Chronicle. We can find differentmodels of a royal ideal in both of the sources. For example, in The World Chronicle of Jans Enikel,King David is presented as a perfect ruler of biblical times, Alexander the Great as a brave, but laterhaughty and depraved one, and Charlemagne as a quick-witted and keen king and emperor. Manyrulers are mentioned in the Chronicle of Otokar of Styria, on the top there are Ottokar II. of Bohemiaand Rudolf I. of Habsburg. Both Chroniclers, Otokar of Styria and Jans Enikel, used the same termsfor royal ideals. But only from The Enikel’s World Chronicle is it obvious, that these qualities had anexample in the Bible and in The Ancient Times."

This is why it is worth investigating the characteristic features of both stages of its disintegration. In our opinion the so‑called North‑South divide, which had always existed in the country’s economy, played a fundamental role in both periods of disintegration. This divide led to significant differences between the regions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941), as well as the regions of the socialist Yugoslav state (1945–1991). Our paper aims to investigate how Tito’s Yugoslavia tried to deal with the problems of regional differences and it will also look at the outcomes of these attempts."

        "After Japan was forced to open its ports to the western powers, by the threat of western navies, it was further compelled to sign unequal treaties with the Great Powers. This triggered a sonnō jōi movement led by young samurai, who criticized the ruling Tokugawa regime for its concessions to the foreigners. They therefore sought to expel the Westerners and close the country to their trade. Their second task was to bring the downfall of the shogunate and the restoration of the Imperial rule. In order to achieve this, many radical samurai mounted murderous attacks against the foreigners. One of the most serious of these incidents occurred in September 1862, when British merchant Charles Lennox Richardson was murdered by samurai from the Satsuma domain. Apart from the previous attacks this time the culprits could be identified. British minister to Japan Colonel Neale therefore demanded the punishment of the assailants and an indemnity from the bakufu for its inability to secure lives and safety of British nationals. The Tokugawa government tried to resist and resorted to delaying tactics because of its fear of internal impact, if it yielded. It was only after the British representatives demonstrated, that they are willing to use the naval forces at their disposal, that bakufu submitted."

        "The Pan-German League was established as a pressure group of German nationalists and “defenders of national interests” in the consequence of the release of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty in 1890. Its founder and an important member was Alfred Hugenberg, who managed to gain support and cooperation of existing nationalist and colonial societies in Germany. The Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband) was established owing to the Hugenberg’s activity in 1891. Although, the colonial policy of Germany was its first primary issue, its interest gradually started to shift towards the Central Europe. The membership of the League was comprised not only of university professors, teachers, clergymen, doctors of medicine, office workers or army officers, but also of important politicians or industrialists. The activity of the League was concentrated primarily on the strengthening of German nationalist ideas in the internal politics of German Empire and the support of the spreading of German cultural influence abroad. The league’s core ideology was a conviction of the German nation’s exclusive mission, right and duty to build a strong Central European and colonial power. To this end, it pursued an aggressive and confident expansionist policy, demanded the broadening of its colonial domination in the world, and promoted the building of a strong navy and other measures which were meant to secure the German Empire a place amongst the great powers of the world."

TheHabsburgs executives maintained this provisional status in both provinces until 1908. Furthermore,Bosnia-Herzegovina was a common administrative district (in German, Reichsland) between Austriaand Hungary. The Habsburg Empire finally declared the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina on6 October 1908.

But I point out that it was István Burián, the Common FinanceMinister of the Habsburg Empire (1903–1912), who proposed the annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovinafor the first time. Burián presented memoranda proposing the annexation to Emperor Franz Josephin May 1907 and April 1908. But the revolution of the Young Turks was a decisive opportunityto annexation. Therefore we should not overestimate Burián’s role in the annexation attempt. Buthis memoranda not only stimulated leading circles of the Habsburg Empire to consider annexationbut also helped matters develop more smoothly in Vienna after the revolution of the Young Turks.As Burián himself later wrote, we should regard him as the true proponent of annexation. Howeverthe analysis about an annexation law, that was founded on the Habsburg’s succession law (in German,Pragmatische Sanktion), proves that the decision-making process for imperial affairs throughthe common cabinet and the minister conference was very complicated and lacked a coordinatingfunction.

The election of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic in late 1935 was the first presidential election with active participation of the opposition and negativistic Hungarian minority legislators of the Czechoslovak National Assembly from both Hungarian minority parliamentary parties, the Land Christian-Socialist Party (OKSzP) and the Hungarian National Party (MNP) who had always cast empty votes in presidential elections until that time, to declare their negativistic attitude to the constitutional limits of the Czech Republic. In 1935, they even supported the presidential candidate Edvard Beneš, the Foreign Minister to whom the Hungarian minority political representation including the very Budapest had a very negative attitude as he had been one of the main architects of the Versailles rearrangement of Central Europe after World War I, refused by the Hungarians, as the Hungarian state had lost two thirds of its territory and about seven hundred and fifty thousand Hungarians landed in Czechoslovakia in position of national and non-state-constituting minority due to it. But in spite of that fact, the Hungarian minority legislators from OKSzP and MNP, with political support of Budapest, sided with Benešʼs candidacy; thus the Hungarian minority was the only one out of the two large negativistic national minorities of the Czechoslovak Republic of that time, besides the minority Germans whose representatives in the Czechoslovak Parliament, on behalf of the opposition and negativistic OKSzP and MNP parties took an activistic attitude, increasing the national-political and the foreign-political prestige of Edvard Beness presidential mandate."

        "The events of the Slovak-Hungarian “Little War” are closely connected to the circumstances of Hungary’s re-annexation of Sub-Carpathia in March 1939, which took place under the motto of re-establishing a common Hungarian-Polish border. Corps belonging to the Carpathian section of the Hungarian army advanced into Sub-Carpathia and then proceeded to attack Slovak territories. Hungaryʼs official explanation for its occupation of Sub-Carpathia ran as follows: since Slovakia has become an independent state and thus Czechoslovakia no longer exists as a state, the Viennese arbitration is no longer valid. Hungary has won the right to exercise its claim to Sub-Carpathia. The military conflict between Slovakia and Hungary came to an end when Germany intervened and ordered the two parties to conduct bilateral negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement. At the negotiations on March 28, 1939, the parties agreed to end hostilities and to establish a neutral zone between the two armies. They also agreed that Hungarian troops might remain at their occupied positions. On March 28 the Slovak delegation announced claims on Hungarian territory by way of compensation, but the Hungarian government rejected these claims. Germany offered no support to the Slovaks on the border issue; indeed, on April 7 Slovak troops were even required to withdraw from various settlements on the Slovak side of the demarcation line. On April 3, 1939, the German Ambassador to Budapest, Otto von Erdmannsdorff, paid a visit to the Hungarian foreign minister, István Csáky; in the course of their discussions, the two men touched upon the issue of the border established with Slovakia. The Ambassador informed Csáky that the Slovak government had turned to Germany for support, but that it had been told that under the circumstances any attempt at the full restoration of the old border, which was Slovakia’s wish, would be futile. The German Ambassador then asked Csáky whether the Hungarian government would be willing to make certain territorial concessions. Csáky responded that this would be inconceivable — “where Hungarian soldiers have trodden, they will stay”. Hungary could keep the 60-kilometre long and 20-kilometre wide strip of land that it had taken from Slovakia. The Hungarian authorities attached the area of land Sub-Carpathia, of which it remained a part until 1944. In 1945 the newly re-established Czechoslovakia was obliged to surrender the railway line between Csap and Ungvár as well as the Ung line: the Czechoslovak-Soviet border — today’s frontier between Slovakia and Ukraine — was drawn ten to fifteen kilometres further west. During its engagements with the Slovak armed forces from March 23–28, 1939, the Hungarian army suffered 25 fatal and 56 non-fatal casualties; it captured 360 Slovak and 211 Czech/Moravian soldiers."

The reasons for this can be traced back to the historical development of economic exchange as well as the complicated political relations between Vienna and Prague. Against this historical background and the context of Austria’s Ostpolitik and Osthandel after 1945, the study delivers a first analysis of economic interactions in the Kreisky era (1970–1983). The post-1945 development of bilateral relations between the two Central European neighbors also hindered improvement on the economic level. In comparison to other Socialist states, Austria’s nationalized industries played a rather small roll in trade with Czechoslovakia. Despite good will on both sides, negotiations on the ministerial level remained complicated. While most COMECON members (except the Soviet Union) continuously faced severe trade balance deficits with Austria, Czechoslovakia’s balance was usually active. By the end of the 1970s, Austria’s deficit grew massively. Additionally, this article presents case studies on trilateral cooperation in the fields of economic and energy supplies. The difficulties in realizing those projects with Poland or Hungary strengthen the image of a highly heterogeneous “Eastern bloc”. The analysis is primarily based on Austrian and East German archival sources."

However, the ordinances of the colonial government did not reflect that as it denied the people access to the land and mineral resources, vesting both in the Crown. This has in turn impacted on the Socio-economic development of the Nigeria area even years after independence. This is because the ordinances under the new gab of Land and Mineral Acts, have offered the neo-colonial actors and their allies the opportunity to continue to corner for themselves large spans of land and oil blocs. This in the opinion of the paper is largely responsible for mass landlessness, low economic activities/productivity among the people (especially among professionals whose means of livelihood are tied to land), boundary disputes as well as occupational conflicts in parts of the country. The paper using qualitative analysis, seeks to interrogate the relationship between the Amalgamation, Land/Mineral Ordinances and the implications of these on socio-economic developments in the area."

Based on findings and confronting other analysed spheres, the author defines the basic stages of the trade development in the monitored period. What he demonstrates is that the trade was greatly affected by political and geographical factors, and the fact that both countries did not attach equal importance to it. The trade in Kyakhta had never reached extent it could have had, but fell into rapid decline as soon as an alternative, cheaper way to trade exchange between Russia and China had appeared. Yet it influenced the town and the whole region development, including culture and education spheres; in the second quarter of the 19th century it substantially contributed to Siberian economics, and in the early stage also to Russia industrialisation as it allowed Russia in economics terms to penetrate to the Far East. The final part deals with the global factors resulting in the decline, and the end of Russian-Chinese trade in Kyakhta, or replacement by other forms of trade exchange."

On the other hand, the Chinese market played an important role in the sales strategy of certain Czechoslovak companies, including those which held a significant position in Czechoslovak industry. Škoda Works and Sellier & Bellot are included among the relatively narrow group of companies which were able to find success in the Chinese market. Their “Chinese trades” were in some respects similar, but in others fundamentally different. Both companies had to face problems which for instance arose from the very specific nature of the unstable and from the Czechoslovak point of view extremely exotic market.

        "As the basic statistical summaries prove, during the inter‑war period China did not belong among the main business partners of Czechoslovakia. On the other hand, the Chinese market played an important role in the sales strategy of certain Czechoslovak companies, including those which held a significant position in Czechoslovak industry. Škoda Works and Sellier & Bellot are included among the relatively narrow group of companies which were able to find success in the Chinese market. Their “Chinese trades” were in some respects similar, but in others fundamentally different. Both companies had to face problems which for instance arose from the very specific nature of the unstable and from the Czechoslovak point of view extremely exotic market. On the other hand, the reasons for their successes in the Chinese market were somewhat different.",

At the Councilof Lyon in 1245 the papacy presented the idea of assisting Russian princes against the Mongolianconquerors. However, this plan was tied to a rather fantastical project of a Catholic mission to OrthodoxRussians which would have enabled mending of the East-West Schism. In addition, the Russianprincipalities were to fulfil the role of a defensive barrier intended to prevent another Mongolianinvasion to the West. While Daniil Romanovich, the Prince of Galicia-Volhynia, accepted Pope’soffer, temporarily converted to Catholicism and was subsequently crowned a king, Alexander denieda similar offer of pope Innocent IV to become a Catholic. The author’s aim is to adjust the traditionalimage of Alexander Nevsky as a rigorous defender of Orthodoxy and intransigent enemy ofboth the Catholicism and a church union. Alexander was a rationally thinking and pragmatic politicianand did not decline dealing with Catholics solely for their different religious beliefs. Naturally,the Grand Prince was a proponent of Orthodoxy, cooperated extensively with the Russian OrthodoxChurch and the idea of a church union was inadmissible to him. The reasons for Alexander’sbehaviour did not stem merely from confessional differences but rather had their own political dimensions.The alliance with the Papal Curia was simply of no value to Alexander. Firstly, the assistanceoffered by the Pope never materialized — as Daniil had to painfully experience. Secondly, theGrand Prince could not have foreseen what kind of relation between the emerging Horde and Russianprincipalities would have developed, and therefore decided to pursue the policy of non-resistancetowards the Mongols."

        "Italian aggression against Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935 placed Czechoslovak diplomacy in a predicament.On the one hand, as a member state of the League of Nations, the First Czechoslovak Republicwas obliged to preserve the integrity and independence of other League members, including Abyssinia,and to apply at least economic sanctions against any aggressor. On the other hand, as a productof the First World War, Czechoslovakia was highly interested in maintaining the post-war orderin Central Europe against growing German revisionism. Here, apart from France and Great Britain,Czechoslovak diplomats put their hopes in Italy as well and were particularly anxious to gain Mussolinifor the defence of Austria. In light of this dilemma, the article examines the attitude and behaviourof foreign minister Edvard Beneš, who was not only Czechoslovakia’s leading diplomat butalso the country’s principal actor in the League of Nations, where the Abyssinian crisis had been onthe agenda since the beginning of 1935. As far as Beneš’ role in the League is concerned, the study focuseson the sixteenth Assembly in autumn 1935, of which Beneš was elected president. While previousworks on Czechoslovakia’s Abyssinian policy are mainly based on documents from the Archivesof the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, this article also uses sources from the League of Nations Archivesin Geneva and the Archives of the Masaryk-Institute in Prague."

        "Italian aggression against Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935 placed Czechoslovak diplomacy in a predicament.On the one hand, as a member state of the League of Nations, the First Czechoslovak Republicwas obliged to preserve the integrity and independence of other League members, including Abyssinia,and to apply at least economic sanctions against any aggressor. On the other hand, as a productof the First World War, Czechoslovakia was highly interested in maintaining the post-war orderin Central Europe against growing German revisionism. Here, apart from France and Great Britain,Czechoslovak diplomats put their hopes in Italy as well and were particularly anxious to gain Mussolinifor the defence of Austria. In light of this dilemma, the article examines the attitude and behaviourof foreign minister Edvard Beneš, who was not only Czechoslovakia’s leading diplomat butalso the country’s principal actor in the League of Nations, where the Abyssinian crisis had been onthe agenda since the beginning of 1935. As far as Beneš’ role in the League is concerned, the study focuseson the sixteenth Assembly in autumn 1935, of which Beneš was elected president. While previousworks on Czechoslovakia’s Abyssinian policy are mainly based on documents from the Archivesof the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, this article also uses sources from the League of Nations Archivesin Geneva and the Archives of the Masaryk-Institute in Prague.",

Following the calm period of the 1920s when even the British Legationin Prague remarked on the qualitative shift in relations between both ethnicities, the beginning ofthe 1930s arrived alongside the economic crisis, which transformed the domestic political situationwithin the First Czechoslovak Republic. According to British Minister, Joseph Addison, the positionof the largest minority in the country had deteriorated, something he thought was due to the factthat Czechoslovak officials were breaching the Minority Treaty and were not doing enough for thewellbeing of its German population, and that this did not bode well for the future."

Due to the unfavourable internal situation, the Christian Balkan states did not possess a sufficient force to defend themselves, and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos had to rely on his diplomatic skills to and personally visited Western Europe in order to acquire an alliance against the Muslim enemy. However, The Emperor did not dispatch diplomatic missions only to the West but to the lands of Rus’ as well. In contrast to the western embassies, the prestige and position of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople also played a significant role — the patriarch addressed a letter to Vasily I Dmitriyevich, the Grand Prince of Moscow, together with Manuel II. The purpose of this mission was probably not to sign a treaty of alliance but rather ask for a financial assistance. This goal was sufficiently fulfilled — the Grand Prince of Moscow and princes of Ryazan, Tver and Lithuania agreed to join the effort to fund Constantinople’s defence. Altogether, roughly 20 thousand of silver rubles were raised by both clerics and laity and subsequently sent in Constantinople during the year of 1398. The gift was amicably received in the city on Bosporus and its citizens repaid this act of kindness with icons, presents and saints’ remains. Further contacts followed, primarily through the efforts of the Ecumenical Patriarch. While Manuel was in Western Europe, the patriarch dispatched another mission to Russia to the Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia Cyprian who maintained correspondence with the patriarch. Based on the research of correspondence and Russian narrative sources, the present paper analyses the possibilities of Russian assistance to the declining Byzantine state and the results of the mission from the perspective of both the Russian principalities and the Byzantine Empire."

        "During the years 1965–1968 Nicolae Ceaușescu came to the partial liberalization of the communist regime in Romania, in order to find a clear position both in domestic and in foreign policy. This fact regarded also the minority policy, which had never been very tolerant since the very beginning of the communist rule. But at least partial steps were undertaken by the RCP leadership in order to win the support of the Hungarian population in Transylvania. The administrative reform in 1968 brought the creation of two new counties with the majority Hungarian population. The meeting of the Romanian leadership with the Hungarian elites, as well as the more frequent visits of Ceaușescu and other party representatives in Transylvania foreshadowed his increasing interest in dealing more intensively with the minority issue. The establishment of the Councils of Workers of Hungarian nationality brought the discussion at least temporary onto the top level of the RCP hierarchy."

        "The objective of this study is to present and analyse the course and consequences of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895 and its relation to the Great Powers’ policies in the Far East. The general dispositions of both participants is assessed, as is Japan’s successful start after the outbreak of the war, the causes of China’s military catastrophes (Pyongyang, Port Arthur, Weihaiwei) and the fact that the Manchu elite had totally failed to comprehend the severity of the situation, thus endangering the basis of the Qing Dynasty regime. Of the Great Powers with concerns in the Far East, the most importance were the stances of Russia and Great Britain, while Germany’s position took a somewhat careful course. The path to concluding peace was very complex not just as a result of obstructions from both parties to the conflict, but also due to the hesitant approach of the Great Powers, Great Britain in particular. By signing the peace treaty in Shimonoseki, Japan, on 17 April 1895, China accepted Japan’s punitive terms which were somewhat lessened through the so-called Triple Intervention of Russia, France and Germany, which resulted in China being returned the Liaodong Peninsula. The course and outcome of the war had exceptionally serious consequences for the overall situation in the Far East. Japan, the new main regional power, acquired massive funds which it was able to use for arming itself and preparing for further war. A weakened China was unable to withstand increasing pressures from the Great Powers and other countries, and these countries soon began endeavours to lease parts of China’s territory, receive concessions for railway construction and mineral mining, and restrict its spheres of influence."

        "This article focus on Slovak‑Hungarian relations. The study aims to draft a more differentiate and precise picture on Hungarian and Slovak revision efforts and the bilateral relations as one may find in any professional literature till now, in particular in non‑Slavic works. The author has used new archive documents and materials. The political climate between Bratislava and Budapest in the first half of 1939 was strongly influenced by mutual territorial claims. Diplomatic relations between Slovakia and Hungary were characterised by three main problems since 1939 and in 1940: the affiliation of the territories in the Upper Hungary and national minorities living there; gaining Germany as an ally at the expense of the other party, and the principle of reciprocity. Ratification of the Slovak State was the most important goal of the Slovak foreign policy in 1939, both within the regional and European context. The Slovak policy also strived to find new and influential allies and believed that Germany and the Soviet Union could play that role. Slovak leaders wanted revision in respect to Hungary and wanted also to reach the revision of the 1st Vienna Award. In July 1939 the Slovak propaganda clearly presented the idea that Slovaks could not accept the borders of their homeland. The speeches in the Hungarian parliament called the attention of the public in both countries to the problems, especially after they published in the press. In practice, they limited the transgressions of officials and police on both sides to some extent. We can say the biggest mistake in the given period was that the governments were not able to rise above the issue of reciprocity and territories, what hindered their possible cooperation against Germans in the future."

Some fundamental problems of logistics that considerably impacted the character of the trade in Kyakhta are described, too. The Russian‑Chinese trade in Kyakhta was profitable for both sides. It yielded important goods for both sides and especially for Russia, which would have not been possible to get otherwise. The core of Russian export was created by hides, furs, pelts and from 1820s also woollen and cotton fabrics, the Chinese export consisted especially in tea, silk and cotton fabrics and rhubarb. Bilateral trade, however, hinted at a number of obstacles. It was considerable geographic distance to cover for both sides and especially on the Russian side, insufficient transport infrastructure. Another set of problems consisted in ineffective state regulation of all sorts on both sides. While bureaucratic restrictions on the Russian side was partially removed in the 1760s, when the trade was overtaken by the private capital, on the Chinese side ideologically conditioned regulation would be still carried over. The Chinese government was primarily concentrated on its military‑strategic targets in Amur Region, which was the trade in Kyakhta subjected to. It used the trade regulation as a tool to press the Russian authorities in other questions. Therefore the trade in Kyakhta had never reached the extent that could have had, and fell into rapid decline as soon as another alternative and cheaper way to the trade exchange between Russia and China appeared."

        "From the 1760s, the question of parliamentary reform in Britain concerning the amendment and extension of suffrage was an important topic of differing intensity. It was a so-called extra-parliamentary movement which endeavoured to reach its objective by means of petitions. The right to petition was an important part of British basic rights contained in the Bill of Rights of 1689. However, the radical reformers of the 1790s who demanded parliamentary reform differed in objectives from their predecessors. The aims of the new radicals were annual parliamentary elections and universal suffrage. Their objective was to achieve parliamentary reform by legal and constitutional means, while openly rejecting violent revolutionary methods. Membership consisted mainly of the working class, with unlimited entry to these strictly organised societies. These societies were so unique precisely because they rejected political exclusivity. The topic of my work is focused on the period of the Edinburgh Conventions which were held three times between 1792 and 1793. Their aim was not to replace the British Parliament with a new legislature according to the French example, but an endeavour to act together on a plan of reform and then to draw up a petition to Parliament. Nevertheless, the last Convention was forcibly dissolved by local authorities and their leading members were brought before a court and sentenced to fourteen years’ transportation in the subsequent political process."

        "At the end of the 19th century Great Britain had to cope with new problems in the Far East. During the 90s the position of its international rivals — especially Russia — rose considerably. This was quite apparent in the northern part of Qing Empire — Manchuria. Britain therefore tried to utilize the deepening of the Russo‑Japanese rivalry. After new Russian advances after the Boxer revolution, London started direct negotiations with Tokyo. Their result was the Anglo‑Japanese alliance, which ended the era of British “Splendid Isolation”. Thanks to this development and naval and economic cooperation of both countries, Japan was able to defeat Russia in the Russo‑Japanese war. This was a clear success of the British diplomacy, which was able to stop its main opponent without going to war itself. On the other hand the rise of Japan as a Great Power meant, that the Land of the Rising Sun became a key factor in the British position in China."

        "The study analyses the German foreign policy after ascension of the German Emperor and Prussian King Wilhelm II, in detail its relations with the Russian Empire and the transformation of the alliance system. It analyses the causes of the deterioration of the German‑Russian relations through observing the foreign‑political, economic and personal aspects. It answers the questions, why the German leadership did not continue in Bismarck’s alliance system, why it refused a treaty relationship with Russia based on the Reinsurance Treaty, and who specifically was responsible for that decision in the ranks of the German governing elite. The author claims that the German foreign policy was not able to timely notice the Russian shift of interest from the Balkans to Middle Asia. At the same time the author points out that even before Bismarck’s departure the German‑Russian trade war had raged, the significance of the Reinsurance Treaty had declined and the later cancelling of the treaty was not the beginning but the end of the disrupted relations between Petersburg and Berlin. The false impression of German diplomats that Great Britain wanted to give up its ‘splendid isolation’ and join the Triple Alliance can be seen as the other important impulse leading to the breakdown of the treaty."

In June 1215, English barons persuaded King John to agree with terms of Magna Carta, limiting royal power in various branches of law. When Magna Carta was proclaimed null and unlawful by Pope Innocent III allowing John not to be bound by its terms, it meant open war with English rebels. They negotiated an invasion of Prince Louis, the eldest son of Philip II, the King of France, and they promised him a crown of England. In October 1216, King John suddenly died in the middle of war and he was succeeded by his son Henry. Henry III was in relatively short time accepted by most of rebellious barons leaving Louis in very precarious situation and it eventually led to Louis’ defeat in 1217. The treaty of Lambeth (September 1217) ended this war with Plantagenets still on English throne."

Stabilization of the country, along with the willingness of European merchants and banks to invest, was the main reason for the rapid development in the production of raw materials. Grain, meat and land became the main sources of prosperity during the 1880s as well as the prerequisite for a carefree government policy. Although Argentina’s disdain during the Baring crisis backfired, its development and prosperity at the turn of the century increased once again.

The German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact of August 23rd, 1939 was a calculated accord with precise objectives when in both systems common national interests, which consisted also in the partition of Poland, overshadowed their ideological differences. This paper outlines the circumstances of the negotiations, the main actors, and motives leading to the creation of the agreement.

The political alliance provided Germany both a feeling of relative security in the war against Poland and neutrality of the second party, including the guarantee of a series of commodities necessary for the war economy. The defensive alliance of Western powers became inefficient. The August and September pacts enabled the Soviet Union to restrict the scope and authority of the Nazi regime in the East European territory by which minimalized the war threat temporarily.

        "This article analyses the problems of the first attempts at modernization of the Egyptian irrigationsystems on the Nile River in 19th century. The focus is on the construction of the barrage inthe head of Delta. This project, commenced by Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali (1805–1848), was intendedto improve the irrigation of Delta and thus increase agricultural revenues, primarily withregard to the cotton production. The engagement of French foreign advisors such as engineers LouisMaurice Linant de Bellefonds and Eugène Mougel in the first phase of the project demonstrates thegreat influence France held over Muhammad Ali’s Egypt. The involvement of British engineers ColinScott-Moncrieff, William Reid and William Willcocks in the later phase of the project, which beganin the 1860s, in contrast reflects British economic interests and the rising of Britain’s dominance onthe Nile."

In this time culminated the polish question in the policy of the First World War constituting the basis of the relations Austro-Hungarian and Germany. The first period after 5th August 1915 after the troops of the too allied powers had occupied the full territory of the former Polish Kingdom was arising a political pressure to arrange the fate of the Polish Nation: government, political system, education, public supply and so on. The political leadership of the Danube-Monarchy had tried to settle the question in the framework of the so-called Austro-Polish-Project added the liberated Polish Kingdom to Austro-Hungary. In the Austrian policy became this concept the leading governing principle against the German ideas to unit Poland with Germany. This solution of the question was a consequence of the aspirations of Germany to the domination of the world or at least of East-Europe. István Burián had been acting on behalf of the Austro-polish solution very consistent, and what is more, with a doctrinarian determination that was followed from his turn of mind: because he had a lot of political preconceptions, he tried to realize this. The resistance of the German Government on the spite with Bethmann-Hollweg was so hard that the ambitions of Burián proved to be as fighting windmills. Burián had been going on the way of the “sub-dualistic” structure in like manner to the situation of Croatian in the framework of the Danube-Monarchy. In his second period as Common Foreign Minister (April — October 1918) has hindered him the defensive trends of the military situation of the Central Powers to realize his imagines upon the Polish Solution."
